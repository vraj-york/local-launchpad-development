# Cursor Local Remote

Control Cursor from your phone, tablet or any browser on your local network. Great for monitoring and nudging Cursor while in the bathroom, watching a movie or cooking food.

A local web UI that talks to Cursor's CLI agent on your machine. No cloud, accounts or other bs — just on your local network. Also added some rudimentary security so that you need a key to access it incase you have many in a Wifi network. Important to only use this on trusted network that are safe, because the security is easy to bruteforce if you are in the same network.

## Cloud API (`/api/v0/agents`)

When using the Cloud Agents–compatible HTTP API, set **`CLOUD_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`** in the environment to a long random string. The server uses it to encrypt stored Cursor API keys and to scope list/detail/conversation responses to the same key you send in `Authorization`.

**Figma MCP credentials:** Launchpad can push each **project creator’s** Figma OAuth access token to `POST /v0/credentials/figma?email=…` (same normalized email as GitHub). The agent injects that value into the ephemeral clone `.cursor/mcp.json` as **`FIGMA_API_KEY`** for `${env:FIGMA_API_KEY}` placeholders. A **`FIGMA_API_KEY`** environment variable on the cloud-agent process remains an optional fallback for local development when no token was stored for that email.

**GitHub PAT:** On project-scoped Cursor agent API calls, Launchpad also pushes the project creator’s GitHub token to `POST /v0/credentials/github?email=…` before the agent runs, so Integrations “sync GitHub PAT” is not required for those flows (it remains useful to pre-register the PAT without a project context).

**Stop agent:** `POST /v0/agents/{id}/stop?email=` (same auth and email query as other v0 agent routes) sends `SIGTERM` to the running `agent` CLI for that id, sets status to `STOPPED`, and returns `{ "id" }`. The agent row is not deleted.

**Auth header:** `Authorization: Basic base64(<KEY>:)` (empty password), e.g. `curl -u "$KEY:"`, **or** `Authorization: Bearer <KEY>`. Cross-origin browser calls use a CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`); those requests do not include `Authorization`, so the server answers `OPTIONS` without auth and attaches CORS headers on v0 responses.

## Good to know

This is essentially an easy way to use the Cursor CLI from your phone or any other device on your network.

You can **start new sessions** from the remote UI and they work fully: the agent runs, edits files, executes commands, everything. However, sessions started remotely won't appear in Cursor's desktop sidebar. This is a Cursor limitation, it stores conversation state in an internal in-memory store that can't be written from outside the process.

The remote UI can see **all** sessions, both ones started in the IDE and ones started remotely. You can monitor active desktop sessions in real time, browse and resume past sessions, or start fresh ones. Messages sent from the remote won't show up in the IDE's chat view, but the work the agent does (file edits, commands) happens on your machine either way.

## Cursor Agent CLI (`agent`)

This app spawns Cursor’s **`agent`** CLI (see `src/lib/cursor-cli.ts`). Install it once on your machine:

```bash
curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
# Then ensure ~/.local/bin is on PATH (see https://cursor.com/docs/cli/installation)
agent --version
```

- **`clr --update`** updates the **npm** package `cursor-local-remote` only, not the Cursor `agent` binary. To update the CLI: `agent update` (or re-run the install command above).

**Docker:** the `cursor-cloud-agent/Dockerfile` runs the same official installer during the image build and sets `PATH` to include `/root/.local/bin`, so `agent` is available inside the container. The default `CMD` passes `--log` so Next.js prints each HTTP request to container logs.

**Server diagnostics** (stdout / `docker compose logs`):

| Prefix | What |
|--------|------|
| `[cloud-agent:run]` | Agent lifecycle: `launch.begin`, `cursor_cli.spawn` / `cursor_cli.exited`, `publish.enter`, `launch.complete`, etc. |
| `[cloud-agent:git]` | Git: clone/fetch, then `publish.begin` → `publish.commit_checked` → **`push.skip`** (no local changes) or **`push.start`** / `push.done` / `push.failed`, optional `pr.*` |

If you see clone but **no** `push.start`, check `push.skip` with `reason: nothing_to_commit` — the Cursor CLI made no file edits, so there was nothing to commit and **no push was attempted**.

Env: `CLR_CLOUD_AGENT_LOG=0` silences both channels. `CLR_RUN_LOG=0` silences only `[cloud-agent:run]`; `CLR_GIT_LOG=0` silences only `[cloud-agent:git]`.

**Git commit identity (Cloud API / Docker):** After an agent run, the server may commit changes with `git commit`. That requires an author. Defaults are set in code (`GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`); override via environment (see `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` for `cursor-cloud-agent`) so commits show your org’s noreply address.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g cursor-local-remote
```

Then start it:

```bash
clr
```

A QR code pops up in your terminal — scan it from your phone and you're connected.

## Updating

```bash
clr --update
```

Or the same command as install: `npm install -g cursor-local-remote`

I'm actively using this myself on a daily basis, so bugs get noticed and fixed quickly.

## Features

- **QR connect** — scan to connect your phone instantly and continue with phone coding session
- **Full agent control** — send prompts, pick models, switch modes, stop/retry from any device
- **Live streaming** — watch responses, tool calls, and file edits in real time
- **Multi-project** — switch between all your Cursor projects, star favorites, browse sessions across workspaces
- **Git panel** — view diffs, commit, push, pull, switch branches — all from the UI
- **Terminal access** — Access terminal from phone/browser 
- **Session management** — browse, resume, archive, and export past sessions
- **PWA ready** — install as an app on your phone's home screen
- **Notifications** — tab title flash + sound when agent finishes, optional webhook for push-to-phone (e.g. Discord)

## Notifications

When the agent finishes a task, CLR notifies you in two ways:

**Built-in (no setup):** If the browser tab is in the background, the tab title flashes ("Done! - CLR" or "Error - CLR"), the favicon gets a colored badge, and a sound plays. When you switch back to the tab you'll see a banner showing the result.

**Webhook (optional):** For real push notifications — even with the phone locked or browser closed — you can configure a webhook URL in Settings. When the agent completes, CLR sends a POST with a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "event": "agent_complete",
  "title": "Agent finished - my-project",
  "message": "Session abc12345 completed",
  "sessionId": "abc12345-...",
  "workspace": "/path/to/project",
  "timestamp": 1710000000000
}
```

This works with any service that accepts incoming webhooks:

- **Slack** — create an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and paste the URL
- **Discord** — create a [Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668) in channel settings
- **ntfy** — use `https://ntfy.sh/your-topic` (free, open source, has [mobile apps](https://ntfy.sh))
- **Custom** — any endpoint that accepts a JSON POST

Set it up in the Settings panel and hit "Send test" to verify.

## Usage

`clr` is the short alias for `cursor-local-remote`.

```
clr [workspace] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `workspace` | Path to your project folder (defaults to cwd) |
| `-p, --port` | Port to run on (default: `3100`) |
| `-t, --token` | Set auth token (otherwise random or `AUTH_TOKEN` env) |
| `--host` | Bind to specific host/IP (default: `0.0.0.0`) |
| `--no-open` | Don't auto-open the browser |
| `--no-qr` | Don't show QR code in terminal |
| `--no-trust` | Disable workspace trust (agent will ask before actions) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show all server and agent output |
| `-l, --list` | List discovered Cursor projects |
| `--status` | Check if CLR is already running |
| `-u, --update` | Update to the latest version |
| `-V, --version` | Show version number |

```bash
clr                          # current folder
clr ~/projects/my-app        # specific project
clr --port 8080              # different port
clr --token my-secret        # fixed auth token
clr --host 127.0.0.1         # localhost only
clr --status                 # check for running instances
clr --list                   # show all known projects
clr --no-open --no-qr        # headless-friendly
```

## How it works

```
Phone / tablet / browser  ── LAN ──>  Next.js (0.0.0.0:3100)  ──>  cursor CLI (agent)
                          <─ stream ─
```

The CLI starts a pre-built Next.js server on your machine. When you send a prompt, the server spawns a headless `agent` process (`agent -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json`) and streams the NDJSON output back to the browser over HTTP. Session history comes from reading Cursor's own transcript files in `~/.cursor/projects/`, so you see all sessions, not just ones started from this tool.

### Authentication

Every launch generates a memorable word-pair token (e.g. `alpine-berry`) printed in the terminal. You can set a fixed token via the `AUTH_TOKEN` env var. Access is granted by:

1. Scanning the QR code (encodes the network URL with the token)
2. Visiting the URL with `?token=<token>` (sets an `httpOnly` cookie for 7 days)
3. Passing `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for API calls

### API

All endpoints require a valid token (cookie or `Bearer` header).

| `/api/models` | `GET` | List available models from `agent models` (cached 5 min) |
| `/api/sessions` | `GET` | Session list. `?workspace=<path>` to filter, `?archived=true` to include archived |
| `/api/sessions` | `PATCH` | Archive/unarchive sessions. Body: `{ action, sessionId? }` |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | Fixed auth token (otherwise randomly generated each launch) |
| `CURSOR_WORKSPACE` | Workspace path (set automatically by the CLI) |
| `CURSOR_TRUST` | Set to `1` to pass `--trust` to the agent (auto-approve all tool calls) |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: `3100`) |

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with the CLI installed (`agent --version` should work)
- A Cursor subscription (Pro, Team, etc.)

## Development

Contributions are welcome! Mainly created this so I can use Cursor when I don't feel like being at my desk. The whole project was vibecoded with Cursor, obviously. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jon-makinen/cursor-local-remote.git
cd cursor-local-remote
npm install
npm run dev
```
